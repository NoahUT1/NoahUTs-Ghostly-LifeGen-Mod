        "You pounce on a warrior's tail during a mock battle. It's all fun and games until they return the favor!",
        "You meet an elder. They're a bit scary with their old scars and stories, but they let you play with their tail.",
        "You try to explore outside the camp but only make it as far as the elders' den before getting caught. The elders are surprisingly good at spotting sneaky kits.",
        "You mimic the apprentices' battle moves. You're pretty sure you're the best fighter in the nursery, and you're ready to prove it.",
        "You pretend to be a leader, giving orders on top of a large rock you've found. You change the warrior code so that kits are allowed to explore outside of the camp anytime.",
        "The medicine cat lets you sniff some herbs and tell you their names, and it's the most exciting thing that's happened all moon.",
        "During a story from an elder, you fall asleep and wake up with the other kits piling leaves on you",
        "You play hide-and-seek with the other kits. You find the best hiding spot and fall asleep waiting for them to find you.",
        "You sneak a piece of fresh-kill from the pile. It's a bit too chewy for you, but you're proud of your sneaky skills.",
        "You meet an apprentice for the first time. They're so much bigger than you, but they show you a cool trick -- batting at a leaf to keep in in the air so it doesn't hit the ground.",
        "You attempt to catch a butterfly that's fluttered into the camp. It's a wild chase, but the butterfly escapes, leaving you dizzy and your Clanmates amused.",
        "You follow the warriors with your eyes as they leave for a patrol. You can't wait for your turn to explore beyond the camp.",
        "You play a prank on another kit by hiding their favorite moss-ball. The chase that ensues turns into an afternoon of laughter.",
        "You make up a new game that involves jumping over twigs. It's silly, but it keeps you entertained all afternoon.",
        "You try to groom your own fur for the first time. It's a bit tricky, and you end up looking a bit like a hedgehog.",
        "You try to stay up all night just to see what happens. You end up falling asleep a little past moonhigh.",
        "You attempt to learn the warrior code. You mix up a few of the codes, but it's a valiant effort and the elders applaud your initiative.",
        "You manage to sneak out of camp to watch the apprentices train. You're quickly found and returned, but not before picking up a few moves.",
        "You challenge a warrior to a fight. The warrior is much weaker than you thought they were, and you stand on top of them triumphantly.",
        "You accidentally stumble into the elders' den and a nearby warrior drives you out right before giving you a long lecture.",
        "You watch a warrior's ceremony, wide-eyed, from where you're crouching at the entrance of the nursery. You can't wait until that's you up there.",
        "You hear murmurs of evil cats in a place called the Dark Forest and are curious to learn more. However, when you ask the queens about it, they bristle and tells you not to speak their name.",
        "You hear of cats that have traveled far and wide, and stay up all night asking the elders about them.",
        "You see a new cat in the camp and ask the queens curiously what the wrap around their neck is.",
        "You and the other kits play a game where you hide from the queens. They are quite upset when they finally find you, and you don't know why."
